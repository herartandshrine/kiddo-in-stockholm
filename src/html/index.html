        <h2>Hej Hej</h2>
        <p>Published on&nbsp;:<time datetime="2014-11-12">November 12th 2014</time></p>
        <p>This is how you are welcome in Sweden, and this is where your swedish practice stops more or less. You can carry on in english, it's amazing how everybody understand it and have a proper conversation with you.</p>

        <h2>What's the weather like ?</h2>
        <p>Sweden in october is cold and sometimes windy and rainy: be well prepared for this type of weather otherwise it can be a real nightmare. Fortunately, if you want to stop by in a cafe, ask for a blanket to sit outside enjoying a smoke.</p>

        <h2>The living standards</h2>
        <p>Let's say it : Stockholm is an expensive capital. Your bank account must be friendly with you if you want to enjoy the place.</p>
        <p>You go out for a drink ? Well, it's double price compare to France. You want a nice diner ? Just the same, spend your money ! You want a nice handcraft souvenir ? Oh boy, don't even think about it.</p>

        <h2>What's the city like ?</h2>
        <p>If you are into nature, you will enjoy the parks in Stockholm. There are many and even if you don't cross any deer around the corner, you will be pleased to be cut from the city pace from time to time.</p>
        <p>Everything is large over there&nbsp;:&nbsp;the streets, the roads, even the locals are tall. But the most amazing thing is how peaceful and quiet the city is. No madness or asshole behaviour, everything is totally cool.</p>
        <p>Even the homeless begging in the streets are not agressive, there are many, unfortunately, asking for a smoke or spare change but they are standing still outside with their blankets and stuff.</p>
