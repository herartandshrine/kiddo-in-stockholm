          <h2>Hej Hej</h2>
            <p>This is how you are welcome in Sweden, and this is where your swedish practice stops more or less. You can carry on in english, it's amazing how everybody understands it and have a proper conversation with you.</p>

          <h2>What's the weather like?</h2>
            <p>Sweden in october is cold and sometimes windy and rainy&nbsp;:&nbsp;be well prepared for this type of weather otherwise it can be a real nightmare. Fortunately, if you want to stop by in a cafe, ask for a blanket to sit outside enjoying a smoke.</p>

          <h2>The living standards</h2>
            <p>Let's say it&nbsp;:&nbsp;Stockholm is an expensive capital. Your bank account must be friendly with you if you want to enjoy the place.</p>
            <p>You go out for a drink ? Well, it's double price compare to France. You want a nice diner ? Just the same, spend your money ! You want a nice handcraft souvenir ? Oh boy, don't even think about it.</p>

          <h2>What's the city like?</h2>
            <p>If you are into nature, you will enjoy the parks in Stockholm. There are many and even if you don't cross any deer around the corner, you will be pleased to be cut from the city pace from time to time.</p>
            <p>Everything is large over there&nbsp;:&nbsp;the streets, the roads, even the locals are tall. But the most amazing thing is how peaceful and quiet the city is. No madness or asshole behaviour, everything is totally cool.</p>
            <p>Even the homeless begging in the streets are not agressive, there are many, unfortunately, asking for a smoke or spare change but they are standing still outside with their blankets and stuff.</p>

      <h2>Dalecarlie horse</h2>
      <p>This wood horse, made in Nusnäs village in Dalecarlie, is the swedish emblem. They used to be toys for children they are now the most popular touristic souvenir. The horse is a strong figure in Sweden, representing force, courage, loyalty and dignity.</p>

          <p>Arriving in Stockholm center via Arlanda Express around 6 PM. First&nbsp;:&nbsp;get rid off the luggages.</p>
          <p>Then, I booked a table for 19:30 in Icebar, so we're chilling out in the hotel until then.</p>
          <p>In 1962, computer scientists and hackers involved in MIT's Project MAC, an early forerunner of the AI Lab, took steps to alleviate this frustration. Time-sharing, originally known as "time stealing," made it possible for multiple programs to take advantage of a machine's operational capabilities. Teletype interfaces also made it possible to communicate with a machine not through a series of punched holes but through actual text. A programmer typed in commands and read the line-by-line output generated by the machine.</p>

          <p>"He used to be so conservative," she says, throwing up her hands in mock exasperation. "We used to have the worst arguments right here at this table. I was part of the first group of public city school teachers that struck to form a union, and Richard was very angry with me. He saw unions as corrupt. He was also very opposed to social security. He thought people could make much more money investing it on their own. Who knew that within 10 years he would become so idealistic? All I remember is his stepsister coming to me and saying, `What is he going to be when he grows up? A fascist?'"</p>
          <p>Looking back and forth, between the puzzle and her son, Lippman says she initially regarded the offer with skepticism. "I asked Richard if he'd read the magazine," she says. "He told me that, yes, he had and what's more he'd already solved the puzzle. The next thing I know, he starts explaining to me how to solve it."</p>
